# ckpt2r: Checkpoint importer for R (v.3-0-0)

R package to import [Stratovan Checkpoint](https://www.stratovan.com/products/checkpoint) landmark files (*.ckpt) directly into R.

## Info
* `read_checkpoint()` imports landmarks from Stratovan Checkpoint files (*.ckpt) [1] into R[2] so that the Export-step within Checkpoint can be skipped. Returned will be a list of which each list element consists of a dataframe with the collowing columns:
  * **defined:** missing (`M`) or present (`N`), as defined within Checkpoint. When `keep.missing = FALSE`, landmarks with the label `M` will be removed.
  * **X, Y, Z:** x-, y- and z-coordinates of landmarks
  * **LM:** names of landmarks
  * **file:** name of the file that the list element was generated from
* `array_2D_from_LM_list()` converts a set of landmarks loaded with `read_checkpoint()` into a 2D array which can then e.g. be used via [`geomorph`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geomorph/index.html) or [`mvMORPH`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvMORPH/index.html) for geometric morphometrics analyses. The resulting data.frame will have the following dimensions: n.specimens x  n.landmarks*n.dimensions.
  * `remove_NAs = TRUE` will remove all landmarks that have missing coordinate values in at least one specimen.
  * `verbose = TRUE` informs the user if and which landmarks have beeen removed from the dataset in case `remove_NAs = TRUE`.

## Installation
Use the command `devtools::install_github('https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/ckpt2r')` to install the `ckpt2r` package directly from its [GitHub page](https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/ckpt2r).

## Issues
If you have trouble with the package, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/checkpoint_importer_for_R/issues) and I will try to solve it as soon as I can.

# Example R code
```
# if not already done, install ckpt2r
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/ckpt2r')

remove.packages("ckpt2r")

# load ckpt2r
library(ckpt2r)

# read all landmark files from folder without considering potential subfolders.
folder.with.landmarks <- ckpt2r_examples()
landmarks_df <- read_checkpoint(folder.with.landmarks,
                                recursive = FALSE,
                                pattern = NULL)

print(landmarks_df)

# We have several two landmarks 'antenna_prox_L' and 'antenna_prox_R' marked as 
# missing (defined = N). So let's remove these landmark lines:
landmarks_df <- landmarks_df[landmarks_df$defined != "M",]

# now we will convert the table into an array 2D
array_2D <- array_2D_from_df(df, 
                             LM_column = "LM",

                             Z_column = "Z")

# In our case, we have several landmarks that are not defined for all 
# species. Keeping these in the array_2D may cause problems in downstream
# analyses. So let's remove all landmarks that contain NA values
array_2D <- array_2D[, - which(colSums(is.na(array_2D)) > 0)]

dim(array_2D)

#  in the example file case: (15, 51 [=17*3])

# get names of landmarks that are still in array_2D
LMs_present = unique(gsub("_\\w{1}$", "", colnames(array_2D)))
print(LMs_present)

# turn 2D array into 3D array
require(geomorph)

dim(array.3D)
# n.landmarks, n.dimenions, specimens
#  in the example file case: (17, 3, 15)

# Procrustes alignment
gpa.results <- gpagen(array.3D)
# !!! if this returned:
#   Error in gpagen(array.3D) : 
#     Data matrix contains missing values. Estimate these first (see 'estimate.missing').
# !!! then check if you still have NA values in your array 2D.

# this should be fine now
summary(gpa.results$coords)

# plot all LM points of all specimens
for(i in 1:length(landmarks_df)){
  if(i == 1){
    plot(gpa.results$coords[,,i], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col="gray80")
  } else {
    points(gpa.results$coords[,,i], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col="gray80")
  }
}

# plot consensus of all LM points of all specimens
points(gpa.results$consensus, pch=16)
text(gpa.results$consensus, labels = LMs_present, 
     pos = 4, cex = 0.75, srt=-30)

# run PCA
