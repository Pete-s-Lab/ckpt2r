# Checkpoint importer for R

R package to import [Stratovan Checkpoint](https://www.stratovan.com/products/checkpoint) files (*.ckpt) directly into R.

## Info
* `read.checkpoint()` imports landmarks from Stratovan Checkpoint files (*.ckpt) [1] into R[2] so that the Export-step within Checkpoint can be skipped. Returned will be a list of which each list element consists of a dataframe with the collowing columns:
  * **defined:** missing (`M`) or present (`N`), as defined within Checkpoint. When `keep.missing = FALSE`, landmarks with the label `M` will be removed.
  * **X, Y, Z:** x-, y- and z-coordinates of landmarks
  * **LM:** names of landmarks
  * **file:** name the file that the list element was generated from
* `array_2D_from_LM_list()` converts a set of landmarks loaded with `read.checkpoint()` into a 2D array which can then e.g. be converted into a 3D array via `geomorph::arrayspecs()`. The resulting data.frame will have the following dinemsions: n.specimens x  n.landmarks*n.dimensions.
  * `remove_NAs = TRUE` will remove all landmarks that have missing coordinate values in at least one specimen.
  * `verbose = TRUE` informs the user if and which landmarks have beeen removed from the dataset in case `remove_NAs = TRUE`.

## Installation
Use the command `devtools::install_github('https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/chkpt2r')` to install the `ckpt2r` package directly from its [GitHub page](https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/chkpt2r).

## Issues
If you have trouble with the package, please raisean issue [here](https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/checkpoint_importer_for_R/issues) and I will try to solve it as soon as I can.

# Example R code
```
# if not already done, install ckpt2r
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/chkpt2r')

# load ckpt2r
library(ckpt2r)

# read landmark files from folder
folder.with.landmarks <- ckpt2r_examples()
LM.list <- read.checkpoint(folder.with.landmarks,
                           keep.missing = TRUE)

print(LM.list)

# convert LM.list to 2D array

                                  remove_NAs = FALSE)
dim(array_2D)
#  returns: n.specimens,  n.landmarks*n.dimensions
#  in the example file case: (15, 69 [=23*3])

# turn 2D array into 3D array
require(geomorph)
array.3D <- arrayspecs(array_2D,
                       (ncol(array_2D)/3),3, 
                       sep = ".") # p = # landmarks; k = # dimensions; n = # specimens
dim(array.3D)
# n.landmarks, n.dimenions, specimens
#  in the example file case: (23, 3, 15)

# Procrustes alignment

# !!! if this returned:
#   Error in gpagen(array.3D) : 
#     Data matrix contains missing values. Estimate these first (see 'estimate.missing').
# !!! then use keep.missing = TRUE in read.checkpoint) and
# !!! remove_NAs = TRUE in array_2D_from_LM_list() to remove landmarks with missing data.
# !!! In our case, specimen_0001 has the landmarks 'antenna_prox_L' and 'antenna_prox_L'
# !!! marked as missing:

# read landmark files from folder
LM.list <- read.checkpoint(folder.with.landmarks,
                           keep.missing = FALSE)

# In our case, several landmarks were missing in at least one of the specimens and were
# thus removed.
